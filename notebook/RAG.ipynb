    "\n",
    "This project implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** tailored for PDF documents.  \n",
    "The main goal is to allow users to **ask natural language questions** and receive **accurate, context-aware answers** based on the content of their documents.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline consists of three main stages:  \n",
    "1. **Data Ingestion** – extract and prepare text from PDFs.  \n",
    "2. **Retrieval** – find the most relevant document chunks using semantic embeddings.  \n",
    "3. **Generation** – use a Large Language Model (LLM) to produce clear answers from retrieved context.  \n",
    "The system is designed to be **modular, scalable, and transparent**, preserving metadata and sources for every answer.\n",

We suppose as if we see the\\nentire scene at once, but this is an illusion created by the subconscious part\\nof our brain [1]. According to the Scanpath theory [2,3], when the human eye\\nlooks at an image, it can see only a small patch in high resolution. This small\\npatch is called thefovea. It can see the rest of the image in low resolution which\\nis called the periphery. To recognize the entire scene, the eye performs feature\\nextraction based on the fovea. The eye is moved to diﬀerent parts of the image\\nuntil the information obtained from the fovea is suﬃcient for recognition [4].\\nThese eye movements are called saccades.

Self-attention mechanisms and GPT-n family\\nmodels have become a new hope for more advanced models. These promising\\nprogress bring the questions whether the attention could help further devel-\\nopment, replace the popular neural network layers, or could be a better idea\\nthan the existing attention mechanisms? It is still an active research area and\\nmuch to learn we still have, but it is obvious that more powerful systems are\\nawaiting when neural networks and attention mechanisms join forces.'),\n",

To further improve the\\nquality of training data and the model’s generalization capabilities, we d eveloped a data\\nsynthesis pipeline leveraging LLM API, incorporating techniques suc h as Paraphrasing,\\nAugmentation, and Hard negative example generation.

It goes beyond simple image classification by not only \\ndetermining the class of an object but also providing a bounding box that precisely outlines its \\nlocation. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the evolution of object detection \\nmethodologies, primarily focusing on the deep learning era. We begin by contextualizing the \\nproblem with a brief overview of traditional computer vision techniques.

The survey \\nculminates with a discussion of modern architectures, including the paradigm-shifting DETR \\n(DEtection TRansformer), which reframes object detection as an end-to-end set prediction problem. \\nFinally, we cover standard evaluation metrics, common datasets, real-world applications, and the \\nongoing challenges and future directions that are shaping the field. \\nKeywords: Object Detection, Computer Vision, Deep Learning, R-CNN, YOLO, SSD, Transformer, \\nDETR, Bounding Box, mAP.'),\n",

Introduction \\n1.1. Defining Object Detection: Classification and Localization \\nObject detection is a core computer vision task concerned with answering two fundamental questions \\nabout an image: \"What objects are in this image?\" and \"Where are they located?\". The first \\nquestion is a classification task, assigning a class label (e.g., \"cat,\" \"car,\" \"person\") to an object. The \\nsecond is a localization task, providing a tight-fitting bounding box (typically defined by x/y \\ncoordinates and width/height) around each identified object. \\n1.2. Distinction from Other Vision Tasks \\nIt is crucial to distinguish object detection from related tasks: \\n• Image Classification: Simply assigns one label to an entire image (e.g., \"this is a picture of a \\ncat\"). \\n• Semantic Segmentation: Assigns a class label to every pixel in the image but does not \\ndistinguish between different instances of the same object (e.g., all pixels belonging to any \\nperson are labeled \"person\").'),\n",

Object detection can be seen as a \\nprecursor to this more complex task. \\n1.3. The Importance of Object Detection \\nThe ability to detect and locate objects is foundational to how machines perceive and interact with \\nthe physical world.

Background and Foundational Concepts \\n2.1. Traditional Computer Vision Approaches \\nBefore deep learning, object detection relied on hand-crafted features. Methods like the Viola-Jones \\nframework (famous for real-time face detection) used simple Haar-like features and a cascade of \\nclassifiers. Other approaches used more complex feature descriptors like HOG (Histogram of \\nOriented Gradients), often paired with a classifier like a Support Vector Machine (SVM), to \\nidentify objects. These methods were effective for specific tasks but were brittle and did not \\ngeneralize well. \\n2.2. The Sliding Window Method \\nA common technique was the sliding window approach.

The Sliding Window Method \\nA common technique was the sliding window approach. A window of a fixed size would be slid \\nacross all possible locations and scales of an image. For each window, a feature descriptor would be \\ncomputed and fed to a classifier. This method was computationally exhaustive and prone to errors. \\n2.3. The Deep Learning Revolution \\nThe success of AlexNet in the 2012 ImageNet classification challenge marked a turning point. \\nResearchers quickly realized that the rich, hierarchical features learned automatically by \\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were far more powerful than any hand-crafted features. \\nThis discovery paved the way for the modern era of object detection. \\n \\n3.

Introduction and Problem Statement \\n1.1. The Success and Brittleness of Modern Detectors \\nDeep learning-based object detectors like Faster R-CNN and YOLO have become incredibly \\naccurate, forming the perception backbone for many emerging technologies. However, their success \\nis predicated on the assumption that the training and testing data are drawn from the same statistical \\ndistribution. \\n1.2. The Challenge of Domain Shift \\nIn the real world, this assumption is frequently violated. A model trained exclusively on clear, sunny \\nday driving data may fail catastrophically when deployed at night, in the rain, or in a city with \\ndifferent architecture. This phenomenon is known as domain shift. Manually annotating data for \\nevery possible domain is prohibitively expensive and unscalable. Therefore, Unsupervised Domain \\nAdaptation (UDA), which aims to adapt a model trained on a labeled source domain to an unlabeled \\ntarget domain, is a critical area of research.'),\n",
